# Getting to Grips with Git

---
## What You Will Need

You will need two things to get started:

1. A `git` client on *your* computer: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. A GitHub account: [github.com](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)

---
## Why You Need It

Version control has been around longer than the Internet. Broadly, it was designed to achieve three things:
1. A record of and and all edits made to a file containing code.
2. A means of allowing developers to share edits with one another.
3. A way of reconciling conflicts when two (or more) developers edited the same code.
---
### However

Although we naturally connect version control to coding, you can use it **anywhere** that you have files that are changing (*hint:* essays, notes, projects, assessments, code...) and need/want to track them. 

**Bonus:** you *also* gain free backups if your version control system is on a different computer!

## How It Works

The **natural way** to think about managing versions of a document is to have a *master* copy **somewhere**. Everyone asks the server for the master copy, makes some changes, and then checks those changes back in.

This is not how Git works.
---
## How Git Works

Git is **distributed**. You could call it peer-to-peer, meaning that *every* computer where git is installed is **its own server** and has its own *master copy*. 

So every computer has a **full history** of a file or project that been added to Git.

In order to make this **useful**, you need ways to synchronise changes between computers that all think *they're* right.
---
## GitHub

GitHub is **nothing special** to Git, just another server with which to negotiate changes. Do *not* think of GitHub as the 'master' copy. There isn't one. 

---
### Getting Started

| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| Repository (Repo) | A project or achive stored in Git. |
| init | To create a new repo. |
| clone | To make a full copy of a repo somewhere else. |

For example:
```bash
mkdir i2p
cd i2p
git init
```
Or: `git clone https://github.com/jreades/i2p.git`

---
### Working on a File

| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| add  | Add a file to a repo. |
| Move (mv) | Move/Rename a file in a repo. |
| Remove (rm) | Remove a file from a repo. |

For example:
```bash
git add README.md
git mv README.md fileA.md
git rm fileA.md
```
But no one *else* knows about these changes yet!

---
### Looking at the History

| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| diff | Show changes between commits. |
| status | Show status of files in repo. |
| log | Show history of commits. |

For example:
```bash
git status
```

---
### Working on a Project or File
| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| commit | To record changes to the repo. |
| branch | Create or delete branches. |
| checkout | Jump to a different branch. |

For example:
```bash
git commit -m "Moved and then deleted README file."
```
---
### Collaborating on a Project

| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| pull | To request changes to a repo *from* another computer. |
| push | To send your changes to a repo *to* another computer. |

For example:
```
git push
```

---
## Consequences

All changes are **local** until you `push` them. 

If you forget to `push` your changes (e.g. to GitHub) then you are **not backed up** if your computer dies.

## This is *not* easy
