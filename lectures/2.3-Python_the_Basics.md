## Variables

^ At heart, *all* programming is about:
^ - Storing data (or references to data) in variables,
^ - Feeding those variables into operations,
^ - Assigning the results to new variables,
^ - Reporting back.
---
## Variables Have Types

| Name    | Value                        | Type                                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| msg     | 'Hello world'                | `type(msg)==str`                                             |
| answer  | 42                           | `type(answer)==int`                                          |
| pi      | 3.14159                      | `type(pi)==float`                                            |
| c       | complex(5,2)                 | `type(c)==complex` |
| correct | True                         | `type(correct)==bool`                                        |

^ As we'll see in Week 4, everything is *also* an object.

---
## We Can Change Those Types

Message starts as a string:
```python
msg = '42'
type(msg)
```
But we can change it to an integer like this:
```python
msg = int(msg)
type(msg)
```
And back to a string:
```python
msg = str(msg)
type(msg)
```

---
## Variables Have Names

Rules for variable names:

- They cannot start with a number (e.g. `3items` is invalid)
- White space and symbols (e.g. `$`, `+`, etc.) are **not** allowed, but `_` (underscore) *is* allowed (e.g. `my_variable` is fine)
- Case matters: `myVar` is different from both `myvar` and `MYVAR`
- Be consistent: `my_var` is more 'Pythonic', though `myVar` is also widely used, but don't mix these!
- Variable names should be long enough to be clear but not so long as to be impractical: `bldg_height` vs. `bh` vs. `max_building_height_at_eaves`.

---
## We Can't Use These Names

You should not try to use *any* of these words as a variable. Python *may* not complain, but strange things will happen when you run your code.

|          |         |        |        |       |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| and      | del     | from   | not    | while |
| as       | elif    | global | or     | with  |
| assert   | else    | if     | pass   | yield |
| break    | except  | import | print  |       |
| class    | exec    | in     | raise  |       |
| continue | finally | is     | return |       |
| def      | for     | lambda | try    |       |

## Operators
---
## Simple Operations on Variables

Let's start with `x=10` and `y=5`...

| Operator | Input | Result |
| :------- | ----: | -----: |
| Sum | `x + y` | `15` |
| Difference | `x - y` | `5` |
| Product | `x * y` | `50` |
| Quotient | `x / y` | `2.0` |
| Floored Quotient | `x // y` | `2` |
| Remainder | `x % y` | `0` |
| Power | `pow(x,y)` or `x**y` | `100000` |
| Equality | `x==y` | `False` |
---
## Strings Are Different

When you do things with strings the answers can look a little different...

Let's start with `x="Hello"` and `y="You"` and `z=2`...

| Operator | Input | Result |
| :------- | ----: | -----: |
| Sum | `x + y` | `'HelloYou'` |
| Difference | `x - y` | `TypeError` |
| Product | `x * z` | `HelloHello` | 
| Equality | `x==y` | `False` |

---
### Using Strings to Output Information

Obviously, a really common requirement that programmers have is 'output a nicely formatted string containing information about the variables in my program'. 

Over time, Python has acquired no fewer than three ways to do this: 1) string concatenation using `+`; 2) string formatting using `<str>.format(<variables>)`; and 3) the new f-strings using f"{variable_1}... {variable_n}". There are pros and cons to each:
```python
x = 24
y = 'Something'
print("The value of " + y + " is " + str(x))
print("The value of {0} is {1}".format(y, x))
print(f"The value of {y} is {x}")
```
^ I rather like f-strings because they can actually contain any code you like (you could, for instance, write `f"The square root of {y} is {x**(1/2)}" and it would work. However, concatenation is the easiest to learn.
---
## Operators Assemble!

Operators follow clear rules about *precedence*: what calculations are performed in what order. For instance, the following lines of code are *not* the same:
```python
x + y * 2         # == 20
(x + y) * 2       # == 30
x + y * 2 / 3     # == 13.3333333333334
x + y * (2/3)     # == 13.3333333333332
(x + y) * (2/3)   # == 10.0
```
And here's a subtle one:
```python
(x * y) ** 2/3    # == 833.333333333334
(x * y) ** (2/3)  # == 13.5720880829745
```
The full list is [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence).
^ If you're a little rusty on exponents, that last example is the cube root of `(x*y)**2`. So `x**(1/2) * x**(1/2) == x)`.
^ Also notice that with *floats* you do not always get the same result from operations that *should* give the same answer. This is because non-terminating decimals (*e.g.* `1/3`) will always be rounded by the computer because it doesn't have infinite memory. The process of rounding means that you need to be *very* careful comparing (more on this later) floats.
---
## Comparing Variables

When variables are of the same type then comparing them is easy. Let's go back to `x=10` and `y=5`...

| Operator | Input | Result |
| :------- | ----: | -----: |
| `==` | `x == y` | `False` | 
| `!=` | `x != y` | `True` |
| `<`, `<=` | `x < y` | `False` |
| `>`, `>=` | `x > y` | `True` |

But notice, if `x='4a'`, `y='365'`, and `z='42'`:
```python
x > y   # True
x > z   # True
```
^ Notice that the result of any (successful) comparison is a Boolean (True/False). We can save the output of this comparison to a new variable (*e.g.* `z = x > y`).
^ This last example has to do with the way that strings are compared.
---
## Danger, Will Robinson!
Notice the *very* **subtle difference** between `=` and `==`! 

Confusing these two operators is the most common source of mistakes early on when learning to code in Python! One (`=`) does *assignment*, the other (`==`) does *comparison*.

```python
x = 5
z = 10
x = z   # Probably a mistake: setting x to the value of z
x == z  # True, because x and z are now both set to the value of 10
```

**Remember this!**

---
## Forcing a Change in Type

A really common mistake is to think that string (`str`) `"42"` is the same as the integer (`int`) `42`. Here's the output from some attempts at comparison:
```python
x='42'
y=42
x==y   # False
x>y
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
```
If we want to compare them then we'll need to *change* their type:
```python
x > str(y)  # False
int(x) <= y # True
x >= str(y) # Also True
```
^ Notice that in the first example we *can* say that 42 is clearly *not* the same as '42', but we can't say whether it's more or less because that's non-sensical in this context. So this is a computer being *totally* logical but not always *sensible*.
^ Also notice the syntax for this: we have `str(<something>)` and `int(<something>)` to convert between types. These are functions, which we'll spend a lot more time on next week!
^ Why might it be (fractionally) faster to compare integers than strings?

## Conditions
---
## Conditions & Consequences

No matter how complex, conditions always ultimately evaluate to `True` or `False`.

The simplest condition only considers one outcome:
```python
if <condition is true>:
    ...do something...
```
But you'll often needs something a little more sophisticated:
```python
if <condition is true>:
    ...do something...
elif <some other condition is true>:
    ...do something else...
else:
    ...if no conditions are true...

...code continues...
```

---
### For Example
```python
if x < y:
  print("x is less than y")
else:
  print("x is not less than y"
```
Or:
```python
if x < y:
  print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
  print("x is greater than y")
else:
  print("x equals y")
```

---
### Conditional Syntax

The most common sources of syntax errors in conditions are:

1. Incorrect **indenting**;
2. Missing **colons** on conditional code;
3. Unbalanced **parentheses**;
4. Incorrect **logic**.

---

### All of Them Together (Input)!

```python
if hours >= 0:
print("Hours were worked.")
else
	print "No hours were worked.")
```

All **four errors** can be found here, can you spot them?
---
### All of Them Together (Output)!

Output from the Python interpreter:
```python
>>> if hours >= 0:
... print("Hours were worked.")
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    print("Hours were worked.")
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
>>> else
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    else
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>     print "No hours were worked.")
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print "No hours were worked.")
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

---
### That's Better!

Notice that it's _relatively_ straightforward to figure out the **syntax errors**, but the **logical error** is much less obvious. Over time, you become far _more_ likely to make logical errors than syntactical ones. 
```python
if hours >= 0:
    print("Hours were worked.")
else:
    print("No hours were worked.")
```

## Comment Your Code

^ One way to reduce the risk of logic errors is to comment your code!
---

### Make Your Life Easy (Well, Easier)

Always comment your code:

1. So that you know *what* is going on.
2. So that you know *why* it is going on.
3. So that others can *read your code*.
4. To help you *plan* your code

^ You are reminding your future self what your code was *for* and helping to give it structure (explaining==thinking!).

---

### Different comment styles

```python
# This is a short comment
print("Foo")
print("Bar") # Also a short comment

# You can have comments span multiple
# lines just by adding more '#' at the 
# start of the line.

# You can keep code from running
# print("Baz")
```

---
### Comments should follow indentation

```python
# Function for processing occupational data
# from the 2001 and 2011 Censuses.
def occ_data(df):
    #  Columns of interest in data set
    occ = ['Managerial','Professional','Technical',
           'Administrative','Skilled','Personal Service',
           'Customer Service','Operators','Elementary']
    
    # Integrate results into single dataset -- 
    # right now we don't replicate Jordan's approach of
    # grouping them into 'knowledge worker' and 'other'. 
    occ_data = pd.DataFrame()
    ...
```

---
### Easier Multi-Line Comments

The below are not _real_ comments, but they can help when you have a really long comment that you want to make. They are also used to help explain what a function does (called a `docstring`).

```python
"""
So I was thinking that what we need here is 
a way to handle the case where the data is
incomplete or contains an observation that we
weren't expecting (e.g. "N/A" instead of "0").
"""
```

---

### Commenting Tips

Some useful tips for commenting your code:
- Include general information at the top of your programming file.
- Assume the person reading the code is a coder themselves.
- Good commenting is sparse in the sense that it is used judiciously, and concise without being gnomic.
- Use comments to track the logic of your code (especially in conditionals and loops)
