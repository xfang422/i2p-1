## What's a Python Dictionary

> A Python dictionary is just like a real dictionary: you can find things (values) using a word (key) instead of having to read the whole book. So: key ![m](mi_arrow_forward) value.

^ What advantages might this have over a list? 
---
### How Does it Work?

The key can be *almost* anything—an integer, a string, a variable...—that is *unique* in the dictionary and **immutable**. 

A list is not immutable, so you can't use a list as a dictionary key.

^ Again, just like a real dictionary: you don't have multiple entries for 'dog', otherwise the dictionary wouldn't *work*. You might have multiple definitions: which is to say, the key might return multiple values.

### List
```
stuff = [
  'San Francisco',
  'USA',
  837442]
  
# Population:
print(stuff[2]) 
```

+++
### Dict
```
stuff = {
  'city': 'San Francisco',
  'country': 'USA',
  'pop': 837442}

# Population
print(sfuff[pop])
```
^ Technically, we get the same answer from both of these and you will get the answer slightly faster from the list; so why might we prefer the dictionary?
---
## Key Points

1. Dicts are **created** using: `d = { key: value, key: value }`
2. Dicts are **accessed** using: `d[key]`

So the only difference between lists and dicts is: `[...]` and `{...}` when they are created.

### List

| index | value |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | San Francisco |
| 1 | London |
| 2 | Paris |
| 3 | Beijing|

+++
### Dict

| key | value |
| :---- | -----: |
| San Francisco | 837442 |
| London | 8673713 |
| Paris | 2229621 |
| Beijing | 21700000 |

## Manipulating Dictionaries

```
cities = {
  'San Francisco': 837442,
  'London': 8673713,
  'Paris': 2229621, 
  'Beijing': 21700000
}
print(cities['Beijing'])
```
---
### Setting Values

It's the same process to update an existing value or create a new one:
```
cities['Beijing'] = 21716620
cities['Toronto'] = 2930000

print(cities['Beijing'])
print(cities['Toronto'])
```

---
### Getting Values

There are two ways to retrieve values from a dictionary:
1. `cities['Beijing']`
2. `cities.get('Beijing')`

Why have two? Consider:
```
cities['Sao Paulo']
cities.get('Sao Paulo')
```

^ The first triggers an **error**, the second returns `None`. Errors _can_ be unfriendly: do you want your entire Python program to fail because a single city is missing, or would you rather than it did something a little more sensible such as... skipping the row?

---
### Getting Values (cont'd)
```
print(cities['Sao Paulo'])
> KeyError: ‘Sao Paulo’

c = cities.get('Sao Paulo')
if not c:
  print("Sorry, no city by that name.")
> "Sorry, no Longitude."
```

---
### Iterating

Similar to iterating over lists but... 

```
for c in cities:
  print(c)
```
Prints:
```
San Francisco
London
Paris
Beijing
Toronto
```

^ How would we print out the populations?

Layout: Split

### Keys
```
for k in cities.keys():
  print(k)
```

Prints:
```
San Francisco
London
Paris
Beijing
Toronto
```

+++
### Values
```
for v in cities.values():
  print(v)
```

Prints:
```
837442
8673713
2229621
21716620
2930000
```

### Danger, Will Robinson!

> Dictionaries are **unordered** key/value pairs. There is no guarantee that things come out in the same order they went in! They **complement** ordered lists, they don't **replace** them!

---
## A Final Note!

> Keys can be **almost** anything, and so can alues!

```
cities = {
  'San Francisco': [37.77, -122,43, 'SFO']
}
```

^ What is this starting to look like?
