# A Method to This Madness

## Recap

We know that a [function](3.4-Functions.md) looks like this:
```python
<function name>( <input> )
```
And we know that a [function in a package](3.5-Packages.md) looks like this:
```python
<package name>.<function name>( <input> )
```
So is `list` a package?
```python
my_list.append( <value> )
```

---
## Well...

`my_list.append( <value> )` _is_ a function.

`my_list.append( <value> )` is a special *type* of function called a **method**.

---
### What's a Method Then?

If a **package** groups useful constants and functions together in one place, then **methods** are just a way of binding useful constants and functions together **with data**. 

So `my_list.append(...)` is called a **list method**: it *only* knows how to append things to lists. It is **bound** to variables of 'type list'.

---
### Proof!

```python
my_list = []
help(my_list)
```
This will give you:
```python
Help on list object:

class list(object)
 |  list(iterable=(), /)
 |  Built-in mutable sequence.
 |  If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list.
 |  Methods defined here:
 | ...
 |  append(self, object, /)
 |      Append object to the end of the list.
 |
 |  clear(self, /)
 |      Remove all items from list.
 |
 |  copy(self, /)
 |      Return a shallow copy of the list.
 | ...
```

---
### It's *all* Methods

```python
msg = 'Hello World'
dir(msg)
['__add__', '__class__', ..., 'capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', ... 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']
```

And then we can inquire about these methods:
```python
help(msg.capitalize)
Help on built-in function capitalize:

capitalize() method of builtins.str instance
    Return a capitalized version of the string.

    More specifically, make the first character have upper case and the rest lower
    case.
```

---
### Recap

> Methods are functions (or constants) that are bound to an object from a class – so lists can append, but strings cannot (they concatenate using ‘+’). 

**Everything** in Python is a class with method: `my_list = []` is just an easy way to write: `my_list = list()`, and `my_string = 'Foo'` is just an easy way to write `my_string = str('Foo')`. Even trusty old `print` is a method!

### The Last Few Bit of New Vocabulary

From here on out, **nearly all** of what you learn will be new _applications_, not new _fundamental concepts_ and _terminology_.

| Term | Means |
| :--- | :---- |
| Class | The _template_ for a 'thing'. |
| Object | The instantiated 'thing'. |
| Method | Functions defined for the _class_ that are available to the _object_. |
| Constructor | The special method that builds new objects of that class. |
| Self | A reference to the current object. |
