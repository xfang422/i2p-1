# Writing Functional Code
## Let's Get Lazy!

^ Why do any work you don't **need** to?

^ Functions allow us to ![](mi_sync)  code!

^ Bonus: they can make our code more **legible**.

---
### A Working Definition

> Functions 'encapsulate' a task (they combine many instructions into a single line of code). Most programming languages provide many built-in functions that would otherwise require many steps to accomplish, for example computing the square root of a number. In general, **we don't care how a function does what it does**, **only that it 'does it'**! 

---
### What Does a Function Look Like?

> `len(my_list)` is a function.

So `len(...)` encapsulates the process of figuring out how long something with 'countable units' actually is, whether it’s a string or a list.

^ `len(123)` is a Type Error.

^ `len(‘123’)` is not. 
^ ![](mi_question_answer)  Can you think why?

---
### So What Does a Function Look like?

All function 'calls' looking something like this:
```python
function_name(...)
```
Where the '`...`' are the inputs to the function; it could be one variable, 25 variables, a list, even another function! 

And if the function 'returns' something it will look like this:
```python
return_data = function_name(...)
```

### As Code 
```python
data = [1,25,-4,14,7,9]
total = 0.0
count = len(data)
for i in data:
  total += i
mean = total/count
```

+++
### As Function
```python
def calc_mean(numbers):
  total = 0.0
  count = len(numbers)
  for i in numbers:
    total += i
  return total/count

data = [1,25,-4,14,7,9]
mean = calc_mean(data)
```

---
## In Action!

```python
def calc_mean(numbers):
  total = 0.0
  count = len(numbers)
  for i in numbers:
    total += i
  return total/count

data = [1,25,-4,14,7,9]
print(calc_mean(data))
> 8.666666666666666
data2 = [200000,2500000,-4,1400000,70,900000]
print(calc_mean(data2))
> 833344.3333333334
```

---
### But Notice!

```python
print(total)
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> NameError: name 'total' is not defined

print(numbers)
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> NameError: name 'numbers' is not defined
```


---
### Simple Function

By 'simple' I don't mean *easy*, I mean it does *one* thing only:
```python
def hello():
  print("Hello world!")
```
We then run it with:
```python
hello()
```
And that produces:
```python
Hello world!
```

---
### Passing in Information

We can pass information _to_ a function if we tell the function what to expect:
```python
def hello(name: str):
  print(f"Hello {name}!")
```
Now we can do this:
```python
hello("new programmers")
> Hello new programmers!
```

---
### Getting Information Out 

Functions become more useful when we can also get information *out* of them!
```python
def hello(name: str) -> str:
  return "Hello " + name + "!"
```
Now the function does this:
```python
output = hello("new programmers")
print(output)
> Hello new programmers!
```

---
### Writing a Function

```python
def <function name>(<var. name>: <var. type>) -> <var. type>:
  ...
  return <var>
```
This can also be written:
```python
def <function name>(<var. name>):
  ...
  return <var>
```
Python is 'friendly' in the sense that all of the `<variable type>` information is optional, but it will help you (and Python) to know what you were **expecting** to happen.

---
### Complicating Things... 

```python
ds2 = {
  'lat':[51.51,40.71,35.69],
  'lon':[0.13,74.01,139.68],
  'tz': [+0,-5,+8],
  'name':['London','New York','Tokyo']
}

def get_city_info(data: dict, city: str, field: str, lookup: str='name') -> str:
  return str(data[field][ data[lookup].index(city) ])

city = 'New York'
print(f"The latitude of {city} is {get_city_info(ds2,'New York','lat')}")
> The latitude of New York is 40.71
```
