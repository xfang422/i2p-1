# Iteration

^ By themselves, lists and variables aren't very useful if we can only access items either one at a time, or as slice. 

^ But if we can *iterate* over a list (do something to every item in a list) then we gain some **superpowers**.

## *it·er·a·tion*

/itə'rāSHən/

*Noun*

The repetition of a process or utterance.

- repetition of a mathematical or computational procedure applied to the result of a previous application, typically as a means of obtaining successively closer approximations to the solution of a problem.
- a new version of a piece of computer hardware or software.plural noun: **iterations**

^ Most programmers also call these *loops*.

### 'For' loops

- Used with *finite* lists of *definite* length
- *For* each item in this list do something...
+++
### 'While' loops:

- Used with *unknown* or *non-finite* lists
- *While* a condition is still `True`, do something to the list...

### Making the Difference Memorable

### For

This 'simple' loop allows us to print out every element of the list in turn:

```python
geographers = ['Rose','Massey','Jefferson','Von Humboldt','Harvey']
for g in geographers:
  print(g)
> Rose
> Massey
> Jefferson
...
```

Notice the format:

```python
for x in list:
  ...do something...
```

^ Notice that this is the same `in` that we saw with `if 'Batty' in geographers`!

---

### While

This while loop does the _same_ thing, but it does it differently:

```python
geographers = ['Rose','Massey','Jefferson','Von Humboldt','Harvey']
g = 0
while g < len(geographers):
  print( geographers[g] )
  g += 1
```

Notice the format:

```python
while <some condition is true>:
  ...do something...
```

## Nesting Loops

We can use one loop 'inside' another loop! What do you think this might print?

```python
for g in geographers:
  for h in g:
    print(h)
```

Let's puzzle it out... 

---

When you see something completely new, it's often good to:

1. Add `print(...)` statements to see how the values of a variable are changing.
2. Comment out the parts you don't understand so that you can focus on the parts you do and then *iteratively* add complexity!

So I would start off with:

```python
for g in geographers:
  print(g)
#   for h in g:
#   print(h)
```

---

```python
'Rose'
'Massey'
'Jefferson'
'Von Humboldt'
'Harvey'
```

OK, so... 

1. We now know that `g` is the name of a geographer.
2. So the 'outer' loop *on its own* sets `g` to the name of a new geographer in the list on *each iteration*.
3. So if `g` is set to `'Rose'` what does `for h in g...` do?

---

```python
for g in geographers:
  print(g)
  for h in g:
    print(h)
> Rose
> R
> o
> s
> e
> Massey
> M
> a
...
```

^ You've learned two things here... what are they?
^ Whoah, so a string can be treated _as_ a list!

## Recap

#### Drop and give me 20!

**for** iterates once over a collection items (e.g. a list).

#### Give me pushups until I say stop!

**while** keeps going until a condition is False.

## Test Yourself

What will this code print? *[I'd suggest that you **don't** run it!]*

```python
geographers = ['Rose','Massey','Jefferson','Von Humboldt','Harvey']
g = 0
while g < len(geographers):
  print( geographers[g] )
```

---

## Test Yourself (Tricksy Version)

Here's a really tricky one! The following two blocks of code produce the *same* output, *how* are they different?

```python
geographers = ['Rose','Massey','Jefferson','Von Humboldt','Harvey']
geographers.reverse()
for g in geographers:
  print(g)
```

And:

```python
geographers = ['Rose','Massey','Jefferson','Von Humboldt','Harvey']
g = len(geographers)-1
while g >= 0:
  print( geographers[g] )
  g -= 1
```
---
## One More Thing...

Let's go back to the [Lists](2.4-Lists.md) examples for a second:
```python
female_geographers = ['Rose','Valentine','Massey','Jefferson']
male_geographers = ['Von Humboldt','Harvey','Hägerstrand']
all_geographers = []
all_geographers.append(female_geographers)
all_geographers.append(male_geographers)
```
Have a think about how this code works:
```python
for ag in all_geographers:
  for g in ag:
    print(g)
```
